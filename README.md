# Nutrient-uptake

This folder contains R code and an example data set to analyze nutrient uptake rate in streams from pulse release experiment. The model is based on the adevection-dispersion-decay equation. User can choose two forms of nutrient uptake, the Michaelis-Menten uptake or first order uptake, and choose whether transient storage is included in the model.
